This project creates and runs a docker container with python3 and main libraries installed to easily test python-based projects. 

It has two branches: master and python_inLinux. 
The master branch creates and runs a docker container for python 3.9.13. with some basic python libraries (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, sklearn). 

The python_inLinux branch creates and runs a docker container for python 2.7.5 and 3.6.8. in a linux environment (you also have some linux-based commands such as wget, git, gcc etc). 

For quick installation check the "InstallationNotes" on each branch. 
To see which libraries are installed check the Dockerfile.

These platforms can be used to easily test python-based projects without having to install libraries and dependencies in your system.
