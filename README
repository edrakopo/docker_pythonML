This project creates and runs a docker container for python 3.7.7. with some basic python libraries (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, sklearn). 

This can be used to easily test python-based projects (for example codes of Machine Learning-based projects check: https://github.com/edrakopo/MLAlgorithms.git).
